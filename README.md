## üåø Working with Branches

### 3. Create a New Branch
For each module or project, you will need to create a new branch. The module name project will be provided at the end. The branch name should follow this format:

- `web[x]-[provided-module-name]`

**Examples:** 
- `web2-nextjs`
- `web2.5-faucet`
- `web3-ethereum-erc-20`

To create a new branch, use the following command:

```bash
git checkout -b <branch-name>
```

**Example:**

```
git checkout -b web2.5-faucet
```

### 4. Work on Your Branch
Once on your branch, you can make changes, add files, and commit your work. For example:

```bash
# Add new files or make changes to existing ones
git add .
git commit -m "Added project files for <branch-name>"
```
> Replace `<branch-name>` with the appropriate module name.

### 5. Push Your Branch to GitHub
When you're ready to push your changes, use the following command:

```bash
git push origin <branch-name>
```

**Example:**

```
git push origin web2.5-faucet
```

## üîÑ Additional Branch Management

### 6. Switch to a Different Branch
If you need to switch between branches, use:

```bash
git checkout <branch-name>
```

### 7. Delete a Branch (Optional)
If you need to delete a branch locally or on GitHub after it's no longer needed, use:

- **Locally:**

  ```bash
  git branch -d <branch-name>
  ```

- **On GitHub:**

  ```bash
  git push origin --delete <branch-name>
  ```

## üìù Notes

- **Main Branch:** The `main` branch serves as your public portfolio and is protected. You should not push any changes directly to the `main` branch.
- **Branch Naming:** Always name your branches according to the module or project you're working on.
- **Commits:** Make sure your commit messages are clear and descriptive.
