## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Initialize Your Local Repository
Instead of cloning the entire repository, it's easier to work with individual branches in separate directories. Start by creating a new directory for your module or project and navigate to it:

```bash
mkdir <web[x]-module-name>
cd <web[x]-module-name>
```
> Replace `<web[x]-module-name>` with the specific web section and module.

**Example:**

```
mkdir web2.5-faucet
cd web2.5-faucet
```


### 2. Initialize Git and Add the Remote
Initialize a new Git repository in the directory and add the remote repository:

```bash
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/codecrypto-academy/<your-github-username>.git
```
> Replace `<your-github-username>` with your Github account.



## üåø Working with Branches

### 3. Create a New Branch
For each module or project, you will need to create a new branch. The module name project will be provided at the end. The branch name should follow this format:

- `web[x]-[provided-module-name]`

**Examples:** 
- `web2-nextjs`
- `web2.5-faucet`
- `web3-ethereum-erc-20`

Create the new branch and start working on it:

```bash
git checkout -b <branch-name>
```

**Example:**

```
git checkout -b web2.5-faucet
```

### 4. Work on Your Branch
Once on your branch, you can make changes, add files, and commit your work. For example:

```bash
# Add new files or make changes to existing ones
git add .
git commit -m "Added project files for <branch-name>"
```
> Replace `<branch-name>` with the appropriate name.

### 5. Push Your Branch to GitHub
When you're ready to push your changes, use the following command:

```bash
git push origin <branch-name>
```

**Example:**

```
git push origin web2.5-faucet
```



## üîÑ Additional Branch Management

### 6. Switch to a Different Branch
If you need to switch between branches, use:

```bash
git checkout <branch-name>
```

### 7. Delete a Branch (Optional)
If you need to delete a branch locally or on GitHub after it's no longer needed, use:

- **Locally:**

  ```bash
  git branch -d <branch-name>
  ```

- **On GitHub:**

  ```bash
  git push origin --delete <branch-name>
  ```



## üìù Notes

- **Main Branch:** The `main` branch serves as your public portfolio and is protected. You should not push any changes directly to the `main` branch.
- **Branch Naming:** Always name your branches according to the module or project you're working on.
- **Commits:** Make sure your commit messages are clear and descriptive.
